# This is my website
My website is made with Gatsby.js + Contentful.

### Develop & Build

Once installed or cloned locally and all packages are installed you can begin developing your site.

```sh

npm run dev

# Build your Gatsby site
npm run build
```

If wanting to use Netlify CMS as the content editor, then you need to be run the proxy in another terminal tab. Then visit
http://localhost:8000/admin to view the editor.
```sh

npm run proxy
```
