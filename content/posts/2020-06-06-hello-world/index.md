# Hello World!

I'm going to create a hello world with two React components because that's the latest tech stack I'm using at work. 

```js
// Message React Component 
export const Message = ({ content }) => <p>{content}</p>;

// Parent Component
const app = () => {
  <Message content={`Hello World!`}>
}
```
But you're not here to learn React, so let's continue.

First of all, welcome. This is my blog, my own space on the web, there's no ads trackers, brands, cookies, sales,sh*tposting, crappy memes, Elon Musk's tweets, scams, information noise. This is a website owned by me and just me. 

### **I have three simple goals my website:**
- Share my life experiences and ideas to celebrate that you don't make the same mistakes I did or will. 
- Meet people that resonate or disagree entirely with my thoughts so we can start a meaningful conversation.

Let's start this journey.
